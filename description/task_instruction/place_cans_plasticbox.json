    "visual_state_description": "I can see two cans on the table, one on the left and one on the right. The left can is red and the right can is blue. The plastic box is in front of the cans, and the gripper is currently not grasping any object. The gripper is positioned above the left can, but it is not close enough to grasp it.",
    "reasoning_and_reflection": "It's the beginning of the task. The assistant info provides the functional points for placing. I will use them to place the can in correct position. The left can is closer to the gripper, so I will grasp it first. The right can is further away, so I will grasp it after placing the left can into the plastic box.",
    "language_plan": "I will use arms to grab the cans first. And then lift them up to avoid collision with the plastic box. After that, I will place the cans into the plastic box. I will place the left can first, raise the arm a little to avoid collision ,and then make left arm back to origin in case of collision with another arm. After that, I will grasp the right can and place it into the plastic box.",
